# digitalclock
Hello random stranger watching this 
I created a digital Clock using C language 
First I created a clock which Starts from zero and then I created another clock which tells the current time and an idea poped in my mind to merge both the programs and in result I created this clock which shows your current time.

Thank you for your time
